* Thu Apr  9 2015 Jeffrey C. Ollie <jeff@ocjtech.us> - 13.3.2-1:
- The Asterisk Development Team has announced security releases for Certified
- Asterisk 1.8.28, 11.6, and 13.1 and Asterisk 1.8, 11, 12, and 13. The available
- security releases are released as versions 1.8.28.cert-5, 1.8.32.3, 11.6-cert11,
- 11.17.1, 12.8.2, 13.1-cert2, and 13.3.2.
-
- These releases are available for immediate download at
- http://downloads.asterisk.org/pub/telephony/asterisk/releases
-
- The release of these versions resolves the following security vulnerability:
-
- * AST-2015-003: TLS Certificate Common name NULL byte exploit
-
-   When Asterisk registers to a SIP TLS device and and verifies the server,
-   Asterisk will accept signed certificates that match a common name other than
-   the one Asterisk is expecting if the signed certificate has a common name
-   containing a null byte after the portion of the common name that Asterisk
-   expected. This potentially allows for a man in the middle attack.
-
- For more information about the details of this vulnerability, please read
- security advisory AST-2015-003, which was released at the same time as this
- announcement.
-
- For a full list of changes in the current releases, please see the ChangeLogs:

* Fri Jan 30 2015 Jeffrey C. Ollie <jeff@ocjtech.us> - 13.1.1-1:
- The Asterisk Development Team has announced security releases for Certified
- Asterisk 1.8.28 and 11.6 and Asterisk 1.8, 11, 12, and 13. The available
- security releases are released as versions 1.8.28.cert-4, 1.8.32.2, 11.6-cert10,
- 11.15.1, 12.8.1, and 13.1.1.
-
- These releases are available for immediate download at
- http://downloads.asterisk.org/pub/telephony/asterisk/releases
-
- The release of these versions resolves the following security vulnerabilities:
-
- * AST-2015-001: File descriptor leak when incompatible codecs are offered
-
-                 Asterisk may be configured to only allow specific audio or
-                 video codecs to be used when communicating with a
-                 particular endpoint. When an endpoint sends an SDP offer
-                 that only lists codecs not allowed by Asterisk, the offer
-                 is rejected. However, in this case, RTP ports that are
-                 allocated in the process are not reclaimed.
-
-                 This issue only affects the PJSIP channel driver in
-                 Asterisk. Users of the chan_sip channel driver are not
-                 affected.
-
- * AST-2015-002: Mitigation for libcURL HTTP request injection vulnerability
-
-                 CVE-2014-8150 reported an HTTP request injection
-                 vulnerability in libcURL. Asterisk uses libcURL in its
-                 func_curl.so module (the CURL() dialplan function), as well
-                 as its res_config_curl.so (cURL realtime backend) modules.
-
-                 Since Asterisk may be configured to allow for user-supplied
-                 URLs to be passed to libcURL, it is possible that an
-                 attacker could use Asterisk as an attack vector to inject
-                 unauthorized HTTP requests if the version of libcURL
-                 installed on the Asterisk server is affected by
-                 CVE-2014-8150.
-
- For more information about the details of these vulnerabilities, please read
- security advisory AST-2015-001 and AST-2015-002, which were released at the same
- time as this announcement.

* Thu Jan 29 2015 Peter Robinson <pbrobinson@fedoraproject.org> 13.0.2-3
- Add speexdsp as build dep as speex_echo.h has moved - rhbz 1181021

* Thu Jan 15 2015 Tom Callaway <spot@fedoraproject.org> - 13.0.2-2
- update for lua 5.3

* Wed Dec 10 2014 Jeffrey C. Ollie <jeff@ocjtech.us> - 13.0.2-1
- The Asterisk Development Team has announced security releases for Certified
- Asterisk 11.6 and Asterisk 11, 12, and 13. The available security releases are
- released as versions 11.6-cert9, 11.14.2, 12.7.2, and 13.0.2.
-
- These releases are available for immediate download at
- http://downloads.asterisk.org/pub/telephony/asterisk/releases
-
- The release of these versions resolves the following security vulnerability:
-
- * AST-2014-019: Remote Crash Vulnerability in WebSocket Server
-
-   When handling a WebSocket frame the res_http_websocket module dynamically
-   changes the size of the memory used to allow the provided payload to fit. If a
-   payload length of zero was received the code would incorrectly attempt to
-   resize to zero. This operation would succeed and end up freeing the memory but
-   be treated as a failure. When the session was subsequently torn down this
-   memory would get freed yet again causing a crash.
-
- For more information about the details of this vulnerability, please read
- security advisory AST-2014-019, which was released at the same time as this
- announcement.
-
- For a full list of changes in the current releases, please see the ChangeLogs:

* Thu Nov 20 2014 Jeffrey C. Ollie <jeff@ocjtech.us> - 13.0.1-1
- The Asterisk Development Team has announced security releases for Certified
- Asterisk 1.8.28 and 11.6 and Asterisk 1.8, 11, 12, and 13. The available
- security releases are released as versions 1.8.28-cert3, 11.6-cert8, 1.8.32.1,
- 11.14.1, 12.7.1, and 13.0.1.
-
- These releases are available for immediate download at
- http://downloads.asterisk.org/pub/telephony/asterisk/releases
-
- The release of these versions resolves the following security vulnerabilities:
-
- * AST-2014-012: Unauthorized access in the presence of ACLs with mixed IP
-   address families
-
-   Many modules in Asterisk that service incoming IP traffic have ACL options
-   ("permit" and "deny") that can be used to whitelist or blacklist address
-   ranges. A bug has been discovered where the address family of incoming
-   packets is only compared to the IP address family of the first entry in the
-   list of access control rules. If the source IP address for an incoming
-   packet is not of the same address as the first ACL entry, that packet
-   bypasses all ACL rules.
-
- * AST-2014-018: Permission Escalation through DB dialplan function
-
-   The DB dialplan function when executed from an external protocol, such as AMI,
-   could result in a privilege escalation. Users with a lower class authorization
-   in AMI can access the internal Asterisk database without the required SYSTEM
-   class authorization.
-
- In addition, the release of 11.6-cert8 and 11.14.1 resolves the following
- security vulnerability:
-
- * AST-2014-014: High call load with ConfBridge can result in resource exhaustion
-
-   The ConfBridge application uses an internal bridging API to implement
-   conference bridges. This internal API uses a state model for channels within
-   the conference bridge and transitions between states as different things
-   occur. Unload load it is possible for some state transitions to be delayed
-   causing the channel to transition from being hung up to waiting for media. As
-   the channel has been hung up remotely no further media will arrive and the
-   channel will stay within ConfBridge indefinitely.
-
- In addition, the release of 11.6-cert8, 11.14.1, 12.7.1, and 13.0.1 resolves
- the following security vulnerability:
-
- * AST-2014-017: Permission Escalation via ConfBridge dialplan function and
-                 AMI ConfbridgeStartRecord Action
-
-   The CONFBRIDGE dialplan function when executed from an external protocol (such
-   as AMI) can result in a privilege escalation as certain options within that
-   function can affect the underlying system. Additionally, the AMI
-   ConfbridgeStartRecord action has options that would allow modification of the
-   underlying system, and does not require SYSTEM class authorization in AMI.
-
- Finally, the release of 12.7.1 and 13.0.1 resolves the following security
- vulnerabilities:
-
- * AST-2014-013: Unauthorized access in the presence of ACLs in the PJSIP stack
-
-   The Asterisk module res_pjsip provides the ability to configure ACLs that may
-   be used to reject SIP requests from various hosts. However, the module
-   currently fails to create and apply the ACLs defined in its configuration
-   file on initial module load.
-
- * AST-2014-015: Remote crash vulnerability in PJSIP channel driver
-
-   The chan_pjsip channel driver uses a queue approach for relating to SIP
-   sessions. There exists a race condition where actions may be queued to answer
-   a session or send ringing after a SIP session has been terminated using a
-   CANCEL request. The code will incorrectly assume that the SIP session is still
-   active and attempt to send the SIP response. The PJSIP library does not
-   expect the SIP session to be in the disconnected state when sending the
-   response and asserts.
-
- * AST-2014-016: Remote crash vulnerability in PJSIP channel driver
-
-   When handling an INVITE with Replaces message the res_pjsip_refer module
-   incorrectly assumes that it will be operating on a channel that has just been
-   created. If the INVITE with Replaces message is sent in-dialog after a session
-   has been established this assumption will be incorrect. The res_pjsip_refer
-   module will then hang up a channel that is actually owned by another thread.
-   When this other thread attempts to use the just hung up channel it will end up
-   using a freed channel which will likely result in a crash.
-

* Thu Nov 20 2014 Jeffrey C. Ollie <jeff@ocjtech.us> - 13.0.0-1
- The Asterisk Development Team is pleased to announce the release of
- Asterisk 13.0.0. This release is available for immediate download at
- http://downloads.asterisk.org/pub/telephony/asterisk/releases
-
- Asterisk 13 is the next major release series of Asterisk. It is a Long Term
- Support (LTS) release, similar to Asterisk 11. For more information about
- support time lines for Asterisk releases, see the Asterisk versions page:
- https://wiki.asterisk.org/wiki/display/AST/Asterisk+Versions
-
- For important information regarding upgrading to Asterisk 13, please see the
- Asterisk wiki:
-
- https://wiki.asterisk.org/wiki/display/AST/Upgrading+to+Asterisk+13
-
- A short list of new features includes:
-
- * Asterisk security events are now provided via AMI, allowing end users to
-   monitor their Asterisk system in real time for security related issues.
-
- * Both AMI and ARI now allow external systems to control the state of a mailbox.
-   Using AMI actions or ARI resources, external systems can programmatically
-   trigger Message Waiting Indicators (MWI) on subscribed phones. This is of
-   particular use to those who want to build their own VoiceMail application
-   using ARI.
-
- * ARI now supports the reception/transmission of out of call text messages using
-   any supported channel driver/protocol stack through ARI. Users receive out of
-   call text messages as JSON events over the ARI websocket connection, and can
-   send out of call text messages using HTTP requests.
-
- * The PJSIP stack now supports RFC 4662 Resource Lists, allowing Asterisk to act
-   as a Resource List Server. This includes defining lists of presence state,
-   mailbox state, or lists of presence state/mailbox state; managing
-   subscriptions to lists; and batched delivery of NOTIFY requests to
-   subscribers.
-
- * The PJSIP stack can now be used as a means of distributing device state or
-   mailbox state via PUBLISH requests to other Asterisk instances. This is
-   analogous to Asterisk's clustering support using XMPP or Corosync; unlike
-   existing clustering mechanisms, using the PJSIP stack to perform the
-   distribution of state does not rely on another daemon or server to perform the
-   work.
-
- And much more!

* Fri Nov 14 2014 Tom Callaway <spot@fedoraproject.org> - 11.13.1-2
- rebuild for new libsrtp

* Mon Oct 20 2014 Jeffrey C. Ollie <jeff@ocjtech.us> - 11.13.1-1
- The Asterisk Development Team has announced security releases for Certified
- Asterisk 1.8.28 and 11.6 and Asterisk 1.8, 11, 12, and 13. The available
- security releases are released as versions 1.8.28-cert2, 11.6-cert7, 1.8.31.1,
- 11.13.1, 12.6.1, and 13.0.0-beta3.
-
- These releases are available for immediate download at
- http://downloads.asterisk.org/pub/telephony/asterisk/releases
-
- The release of these versions resolves the following security vulnerability:
-
- * AST-2014-011: Asterisk Susceptibility to POODLE Vulnerability
-
-   Asterisk is susceptible to the POODLE vulnerability in two ways:
-   1) The res_jabber and res_xmpp module both use SSLv3 exclusively for their
-      encrypted connections.
-   2) The core TLS handling in Asterisk, which is used by the chan_sip channel
-      driver, Asterisk Manager Interface (AMI), and Asterisk HTTP Server, by
-      default allow a TLS connection to fallback to SSLv3. This allows for a
-      MITM to potentially force a connection to fallback to SSLv3, exposing it
-      to the POODLE vulnerability.
-
-   These issues have been resolved in the versions released in conjunction with
-   this security advisory.
-
- For more information about the details of this vulnerability, please read
- security advisory AST-2014-011, which was released at the same time as this
- announcement.

- Rebuilt for https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Fedora_21_22_Mass_Rebuild

* Thu Jun 19 2014 Jeffrey Ollie <jeff@ocjtech.us> - 11.10.2-2:

* Thu Jun 19 2014 Jeffrey Ollie <jeff@ocjtech.us> - 11.10.2-1:
- The Asterisk Development Team has announced security releases for Certified
- Asterisk 1.8.15, 11.6, and Asterisk 1.8, 11, and 12. The available security
- releases are released as versions 1.8.15-cert7, 11.6-cert4, 1.8.28.2, 11.10.2,
- and 12.3.2.
-
- These releases are available for immediate download at
- http://downloads.asterisk.org/pub/telephony/asterisk/releases
-
- These releases resolve security vulnerabilities that were previously fixed in
- 1.8.15-cert6, 11.6-cert3, 1.8.28.1, 11.10.1, and 12.3.1. Unfortunately, the fix
- for AST-2014-007 inadvertently introduced a regression in Asterisk's TCP and TLS
- handling that prevented Asterisk from sending data over these transports. This
- regression and the security vulnerabilities have been fixed in the versions
- specified in this release announcement.
-
- The security patches for AST-2014-007 have been updated with the fix for the
- regression, and are available at http://downloads.asterisk.org/pub/security
-
- Please note that the release of these versions resolves the following security
- vulnerabilities:
-
- * AST-2014-005: Remote Crash in PJSIP Channel Driver's Publish/Subscribe
-                 Framework
-
- * AST-2014-006: Permission Escalation via Asterisk Manager User Unauthorized
-                 Shell Access
-
- * AST-2014-007: Denial of Service via Exhaustion of Allowed Concurrent HTTP
-                 Connections
-
- * AST-2014-008: Denial of Service in PJSIP Channel Driver Subscriptions
-
- For more information about the details of these vulnerabilities, please read
- security advisories AST-2014-005, AST-2014-006, AST-2014-007, and AST-2014-008,
- which were released with the previous versions that addressed these
- vulnerabilities.

* Thu Jun 19 2014 Jeffrey Ollie <jeff@ocjtech.us> - 11.10.1-1:
- The Asterisk Development Team has announced security releases for Certified
- Asterisk 1.8.15, 11.6, and Asterisk 1.8, 11, and 12. The available security
- releases are released as versions 1.8.15-cert6, 11.6-cert3, 1.8.28.1, 11.10.1,
- and 12.3.1.
-
- These releases are available for immediate download at
- http://downloads.asterisk.org/pub/telephony/asterisk/releases
-
- The release of these versions resolves the following issue:
-
- * AST-2014-007: Denial of Service via Exhaustion of Allowed Concurrent HTTP
-                 Connections
-
-   Establishing a TCP or TLS connection to the configured HTTP or HTTPS port
-   respectively in http.conf and then not sending or completing a HTTP request
-   will tie up a HTTP session. By doing this repeatedly until the maximum number
-   of open HTTP sessions is reached, legitimate requests are blocked.
-
- Additionally, the release of 11.6-cert3, 11.10.1, and 12.3.1 resolves the
- following issue:
-
- * AST-2014-006: Permission Escalation via Asterisk Manager User Unauthorized
-                 Shell Access
-
-   Manager users can execute arbitrary shell commands with the MixMonitor manager
-   action. Asterisk does not require system class authorization for a manager
-   user to use the MixMonitor action, so any manager user who is permitted to use
-   manager commands can potentially execute shell commands as the user executing
-   the Asterisk process.
-
- Additionally, the release of 12.3.1 resolves the following issues:
-
- * AST-2014-005: Remote Crash in PJSIP Channel Driver's Publish/Subscribe
-                 Framework
-
-   A remotely exploitable crash vulnerability exists in the PJSIP channel
-   driver's pub/sub framework. If an attempt is made to unsubscribe when not
-   currently subscribed and the endpoint's “sub_min_expiry” is set to zero,
-   Asterisk tries to create an expiration timer with zero seconds, which is not
-   allowed, so an assertion raised.
-
- * AST-2014-008: Denial of Service in PJSIP Channel Driver Subscriptions
-
-   When a SIP transaction timeout caused a subscription to be terminated, the
-   action taken by Asterisk was guaranteed to deadlock the thread on which SIP
-   requests are serviced. Note that this behavior could only happen on
-   established subscriptions, meaning that this could only be exploited if an
-   attacker bypassed authentication and successfully subscribed to a real
-   resource on the Asterisk server.
-
- These issues and their resolutions are described in the security advisories.
-
- For more information about the details of these vulnerabilities, please read
- security advisories AST-2014-005, AST-2014-006, AST-2014-007, and AST-2014-008,
- which were released at the same time as this announcement.

* Tue Mar 11 2014 Jeffrey Ollie <jeff@ocjtech.us> - 11.8.1-1:
- The Asterisk Development Team has announced security releases for Certified
- Asterisk 1.8.15, 11.6, and Asterisk 1.8, 11, and 12. The available security
- releases are released as versions 1.8.15-cert5, 11.6-cert2, 1.8.26.1, 11.8.1,
- and 12.1.1.
-
- These releases are available for immediate download at
- http://downloads.asterisk.org/pub/telephony/asterisk/releases
-
- The release of these versions resolve the following issues:
-
- * AST-2014-001: Stack overflow in HTTP processing of Cookie headers.
-
-   Sending a HTTP request that is handled by Asterisk with a large number of
-   Cookie headers could overflow the stack.
-
-   Another vulnerability along similar lines is any HTTP request with a
-   ridiculous number of headers in the request could exhaust system memory.
-
- * AST-2014-002: chan_sip: Exit early on bad session timers request
-
-   This change allows chan_sip to avoid creation of the channel and
-   consumption of associated file descriptors altogether if the inbound
-   request is going to be rejected anyway.
-
- Additionally, the release of 12.1.1 resolves the following issue:
-
- * AST-2014-003: res_pjsip: When handling 401/407 responses don't assume a
-   request will have an endpoint.
-
-   This change removes the assumption that an outgoing request will always
-   have an endpoint and makes the authenticate_qualify option work once again.
-
- Finally, a security advisory, AST-2014-004, was released for a vulnerability
- fixed in Asterisk 12.1.0. Users of Asterisk 12.0.0 are encouraged to upgrade to
- 12.1.1 to resolve both vulnerabilities.
-
- These issues and their resolutions are described in the security advisories.
-
- For more information about the details of these vulnerabilities, please read
- security advisories AST-2014-001, AST-2014-002, AST-2014-003, and AST-2014-004,
- which were released at the same time as this announcement.

* Sat Dec 28 2013 Jeffrey Ollie <jeff@ocjtech.us> - 11.6.1-1:
- The Asterisk Development Team has announced security releases for Certified
- Asterisk 1.8.15, 11.2, and Asterisk 1.8, 10, and 11. The available security
- releases are released as versions 1.8.15-cert4, 11.2-cert3, 1.8.24.1, 10.12.4,
- 10.12.4-digiumphones, and 11.6.1.
-
- These releases are available for immediate download at
- http://downloads.asterisk.org/pub/telephony/asterisk/releases
-
- The release of these versions resolve the following issues:
-
- * A buffer overflow when receiving odd length 16 bit messages in app_sms. An
-   infinite loop could occur which would overwrite memory when a message is
-   received into the unpacksms16() function and the length of the message is an
-   odd number of bytes.
-
- * Prevent permissions escalation in the Asterisk Manager Interface. Asterisk
-   now marks certain individual dialplan functions as 'dangerous', which will
-   inhibit their execution from external sources.
-
-   A 'dangerous' function is one which results in a privilege escalation. For
-   example, if one were to read the channel variable SHELL(rm -rf /) Bad
-   Things(TM) could happen; even if the external source has only read
-   permissions.
-
-   Execution from external sources may be enabled by setting 'live_dangerously'
-   to 'yes' in the [options] section of asterisk.conf. Although doing so is not
-   recommended.
-
- These issues and their resolutions are described in the security advisories.
-
- For more information about the details of these vulnerabilities, please read
- security advisories AST-2013-006 and AST-2013-007, which were
- released at the same time as this announcement.

-
- * A remotely exploitable crash vulnerability exists in the SIP channel driver if
-   an invalid SDP is sent in a SIP request that defines media descriptions before
-   connection information. The handling code incorrectly attempts to reference
-   the socket address information even though that information has not yet been
-   set.
-
- These issues and their resolutions are described in the security advisories.

* Thu Mar 28 2013 Jeffrey Ollie <jeff@ocjtech.us> - 11.2.2-1:
- The Asterisk Development Team has announced security releases for Certified
- Asterisk 1.8.15 and Asterisk 1.8, 10, and 11. The available security releases
- are released as versions 1.8.15-cert2, 1.8.20.2, 10.12.2, 10.12.2-digiumphones,
- and 11.2.2.
-
- These releases are available for immediate download at
- http://downloads.asterisk.org/pub/telephony/asterisk/releases
-
- The release of these versions resolve the following issues:
-
- * A possible buffer overflow during H.264 format negotiation. The format
-   attribute resource for H.264 video performs an unsafe read against a media
-   attribute when parsing the SDP.
-
-   This vulnerability only affected Asterisk 11.
-
- * A denial of service exists in Asterisk's HTTP server. AST-2012-014, fixed
-   in January of this year, contained a fix for Asterisk's HTTP server for a
-   remotely-triggered crash. While the fix prevented the crash from being
-   triggered, a denial of service vector still exists with that solution if an
-   attacker sends one or more HTTP POST requests with very large Content-Length
-   values.
-
-   This vulnerability affects Certified Asterisk 1.8.15, Asterisk 1.8, 10, and 11
-
- * A potential username disclosure exists in the SIP channel driver. When
-   authenticating a SIP request with alwaysauthreject enabled, allowguest
-   disabled, and autocreatepeer disabled, Asterisk discloses whether a user
-   exists for INVITE, SUBSCRIBE, and REGISTER transactions in multiple ways.
-
-   This vulnerability affects Certified Asterisk 1.8.15, Asterisk 1.8, 10, and 11
-
- These issues and their resolutions are described in the security advisories.
-
- For more information about the details of these vulnerabilities, please read
- security advisories AST-2013-001, AST-2013-002, and AST-2013-003, which were
- released at the same time as this announcement.

* Thu Jan  3 2013 Jeffrey Ollie <jeff@ocjtech.us> - 11.1.2-1:
- The Asterisk Development Team has announced a security release for Asterisk 11,
- Asterisk 11.1.2. This release addresses the security vulnerabilities reported in
- AST-2012-014 and AST-2012-015, and replaces the previous version of Asterisk 11
- released for these security vulnerabilities. The prior release left open a
- vulnerability in res_xmpp that exists only in Asterisk 11; as such, other
- versions of Asterisk were resolved correctly by the previous releases.
-
- This release is available for immediate download at
- http://downloads.asterisk.org/pub/telephony/asterisk/releases
-
- The release of these versions resolve the following two issues:
-
- * Stack overflows that occur in some portions of Asterisk that manage a TCP
-   connection. In SIP, this is exploitable via a remote unauthenticated session;
-   in XMPP and HTTP connections, this is exploitable via remote authenticated
-   sessions. The vulnerabilities in SIP and HTTP were corrected in a prior
-   release of Asterisk; the vulnerability in XMPP is resolved in this release.
-
- * A denial of service vulnerability through exploitation of the device state
-   cache. Anonymous calls had the capability to create devices in Asterisk that
-   would never be disposed of. Handling the cachability of device states
-   aggregated via XMPP is handled in this release.
-
- These issues and their resolutions are described in the security advisories.
-
- For more information about the details of these vulnerabilities, please read
- security advisories AST-2012-014 and AST-2012-015.

- to do this twice!

- The release of these versions resolve the following two issues:
-
- * Stack overflows that occur in some portions of Asterisk that manage a TCP
-   connection. In SIP, this is exploitable via a remote unauthenticated session;
-   in XMPP and HTTP connections, this is exploitable via remote authenticated
-   sessions.
-
- * A denial of service vulnerability through exploitation of the device state
-   cache. Anonymous calls had the capability to create devices in Asterisk that
-   would never be disposed of.
-
- These issues and their resolutions are described in the security advisories.
-
- For more information about the details of these vulnerabilities, please read
- security advisories AST-2012-014 and AST-2012-015, which were released at the
- same time as this announcement.

* Tue Oct 30 2012 Jeffrey Ollie <jeff@ocjtech.us> - 11.0.0-1:
- The Asterisk Development Team is pleased to announce the release of
- Asterisk 11.0.0.  This release is available for immediate download at
- http://downloads.asterisk.org/pub/telephony/asterisk/releases
-
- Asterisk 11 is the next major release series of Asterisk.  It is a Long Term
- Support (LTS) release, similar to Asterisk 1.8.  For more information about
- support time lines for Asterisk releases, see the Asterisk versions page:
- https://wiki.asterisk.org/wiki/display/AST/Asterisk+Versions
-
- For important information regarding upgrading to Asterisk 11, please see the
- Asterisk wiki:
-
- https://wiki.asterisk.org/wiki/display/AST/Upgrading+to+Asterisk+11
-
- A short list of new features includes:
-
- * A new channel driver named chan_motif has been added which provides support
-   for Google Talk and Jingle in a single channel driver.  This new channel
-   driver includes support for both audio and video, RFC2833 DTMF, all codecs
-   supported by Asterisk, hold, unhold, and ringing notification. It is also
-   compliant with the current Jingle specification, current Google Jingle
-   specification, and the original Google Talk protocol.
-
- * Support for the WebSocket transport for chan_sip.
-
- * SIP peers can now be configured to support negotiation of ICE candidates.
-
- * The app_page application now no longer depends on DAHDI or app_meetme. It
-   has been re-architected to use app_confbridge internally.
-
- * Hangup handlers can be attached to channels using the CHANNEL() function.
-   Hangup handlers will run when the channel is hung up similar to the h
-   extension; however, unlike an h extension, a hangup handler is associated with
-   the actual channel and will execute anytime that channel is hung up,
-   regardless of where it is in the dialplan.
-
- * Added pre-dial handlers for the Dial and Follow-Me applications.  Pre-dial
-   allows you to execute a dialplan subroutine on a channel before a call is
-   placed but after the application performing a dial action is invoked. This
-   means that the handlers are executed after the creation of the callee
-   channels, but before any actions have been taken to actually dial the callee
-   channels.
-
- * Log messages can now be easily associated with a certain call by looking at
-   a new unique identifier, "Call Id".  Call ids are attached to log messages for
-   just about any case where it can be determined that the message is related
-   to a particular call.
-
- * Introduced Named ACLs as a new way to define Access Control Lists (ACLs) in
-   Asterisk. Unlike traditional ACLs defined in specific module configuration
-   files, Named ACLs can be shared across multiple modules.
-
- * The Hangup Cause family of functions and dialplan applications allow for
-   inspection of the hangup cause codes for each channel involved in a call.
-   This allows a dialplan writer to determine, for each channel, who hung up and
-   for what reason(s).
-
- * Two new functions have been added: FEATURE() and FEATUREMAP(). FEATURE()
-   lets you set some of the configuration options from the general section
-   of features.conf on a per-channel basis. FEATUREMAP() lets you customize
-   the key sequence used to activate built-in features, such as blindxfer,
-   and automon.
-
- * Support for DTLS-SRTP in chan_sip.
-
- * Support for named pickupgroups/callgroups, allowing any number of pickupgroups
-   and callgroups to be defined for several channel drivers.
-
- * IPv6 Support for AMI, AGI, ExternalIVR, and the SIP Security Event Framework.
-
- More information about the new features can be found on the Asterisk wiki:

- https://wiki.asterisk.org/wiki/display/AST/Asterisk+11+Documentation

* Thu Aug 30 2012 Jeffrey Ollie <jeff@ocjtech.us> - 10.7.1-1
- The Asterisk Development Team has announced security releases for Certified
- Asterisk 1.8.11 and Asterisk 1.8 and 10. The available security releases are
- released as versions 1.8.11-cert7, 1.8.15.1, 10.7.1, and 10.7.1-digiumphones.
-
- These releases are available for immediate download at
- http://downloads.asterisk.org/pub/telephony/asterisk/releases
-
- The release of Asterisk 1.8.11-cert7, 1.8.15.1, 10.7.1, and 10.7.1-digiumphones
- resolve the following two issues:
-
- * A permission escalation vulnerability in Asterisk Manager Interface.  This
-   would potentially allow remote authenticated users the ability to execute
-   commands on the system shell with the privileges of the user running the
-   Asterisk application.  Please note that the README-SERIOUSLY.bestpractices.txt
-   file delivered with Asterisk has been updated due to this and other related
-   vulnerabilities fixed in previous versions of Asterisk.
-
- * When an IAX2 call is made using the credentials of a peer defined in a
-   dynamic Asterisk Realtime Architecture (ARA) backend, the ACL rules for that
-   peer are not applied to the call attempt. This allows for a remote attacker
-   who is aware of a peer's credentials to bypass the ACL rules set for that
-   peer.
-
- These issues and their resolutions are described in the security advisories.
-
- For more information about the details of these vulnerabilities, please read
- security advisories AST-2012-012 and AST-2012-013, which were released at the
- same time as this announcement.

* Sat Aug 18 2012 Jeffrey Ollie <jeff@ocjtech.us> - 11.0.0-0.2.beta1
- The Asterisk Development Team is pleased to announce the first beta release of
- Asterisk 11.0.0.  This release is available for immediate download at
- http://downloads.asterisk.org/pub/telephony/asterisk/releases
-
- All interested users of Asterisk are encouraged to participate in the
- Asterisk 11 testing process.  Please report any issues found to the issue
- tracker, https://issues.asterisk.org/jira.  It is also very useful to see
- successful test reports.  Please post those to the asterisk-dev mailing list.
- All Asterisk users are invited to participate in the #asterisk-testing channel
- on IRC to work together in testing the many parts of Asterisk.
-
- Asterisk 11 is the next major release series of Asterisk.  It will be a Long
- Term Support (LTS) release, similar to Asterisk 1.8.  For more information about
- support time lines for Asterisk releases, see the Asterisk versions page:
- https://wiki.asterisk.org/wiki/display/AST/Asterisk+Versions
-
- For important information regarding upgrading to Asterisk 11, please see the
- Asterisk wiki:
-
- https://wiki.asterisk.org/wiki/display/AST/Upgrading+to+Asterisk+11
-
- A short list of new features includes:
-
- * A new channel driver named chan_motif has been added which provides support
-   for Google Talk and Jingle in a single channel driver.  This new channel
-   driver includes support for both audio and video, RFC2833 DTMF, all codecs
-   supported by Asterisk, hold, unhold, and ringing notification. It is also
-   compliant with the current Jingle specification, current Google Jingle
-   specification, and the original Google Talk protocol.
-
- * Support for the WebSocket transport for chan_sip.
-
- * SIP peers can now be configured to support negotiation of ICE candidates.
-
- * The app_page application now no longer depends on DAHDI or app_meetme. It
-   has been re-architected to use app_confbridge internally.
-
- * Hangup handlers can be attached to channels using the CHANNEL() function.
-   Hangup handlers will run when the channel is hung up similar to the h
-   extension; however, unlike an h extension, a hangup handler is associated with
-   the actual channel and will execute anytime that channel is hung up,
-   regardless of where it is in the dialplan.
-
- * Added pre-dial handlers for the Dial and Follow-Me applications.  Pre-dial
-   allows you to execute a dialplan subroutine on a channel before a call is
-   placed but after the application performing a dial action is invoked. This
-   means that the handlers are executed after the creation of the caller/callee
-   channels, but before any actions have been taken to actually dial the callee
-   channels.
-
- * Log messages can now be easily associated with a certain call by looking at
-   a new unique identifier, "Call Id".  Call ids are attached to log messages for
-   just about any case where it can be determined that the message is related
-   to a particular call.
-
- * Introduced Named ACLs as a new way to define Access Control Lists (ACLs) in
-   Asterisk. Unlike traditional ACLs defined in specific module configuration
-   files, Named ACLs can be shared across multiple modules.
-
- * The Hangup Cause family of functions and dialplan applications allow for
-   inspection of the hangup cause codes for each channel involved in a call.
-   This allows a dialplan writer to determine, for each channel, who hung up and
-   for what reason(s).
-
- * Two new functions have been added: FEATURE() and FEATUREMAP(). FEATURE()
-   lets you set some of the configuration options from the general section
-   of features.conf on a per-channel basis. FEATUREMAP() lets you customize
-   the key sequence used to activate built-in features, such as blindxfer,
-   and automon.
-
- * Support for named pickupgroups/callgroups, allowing any number of pickupgroups
-   and callgroups to be defined for several channel drivers.
-
- * IPv6 Support for AMI, AGI, ExternalIVR, and the SIP Security Event Framework.
-
- More information about the new features can be found on the Asterisk wiki:
-
- https://wiki.asterisk.org/wiki/display/AST/Asterisk+11+Documentation

* Thu Jul  5 2012 Jeffrey Ollie <jeff@ocjtech.us> - 10.5.2-1:
- The Asterisk Development Team has announced security releases for Certified
- Asterisk 1.8.11 and Asterisk 1.8 and 10. The available security releases are
- released as versions 1.8.11-cert4, 1.8.13.1, 10.5.2, and 10.5.2-digiumphones.
-
- These releases are available for immediate download at
- http://downloads.asterisk.org/pub/telephony/asterisk/releases
-
- The release of Asterisk 1.8.11-cert4, 1.8.13.1, 10.5.2, and 10.5.2-digiumphones
- resolve the following two issues:
-
- * If Asterisk sends a re-invite and an endpoint responds to the re-invite with
-   a provisional response but never sends a final response, then the SIP dialog
-   structure is never freed and the RTP ports for the call are never released. If
-   an attacker has the ability to place a call, they could create a denial of
-   service by using all available RTP ports.
-
- * If a single voicemail account is manipulated by two parties simultaneously,
-   a condition can occur where memory is freed twice causing a crash.
-
- These issues and their resolution are described in the security advisories.
-
- For more information about the details of these vulnerabilities, please read
- security advisories AST-2012-010 and AST-2012-011, which were released at the

- This security release is released as version 10.5.1.
-
- The release is available for immediate download at
- http://downloads.asterisk.org/pub/telephony/asterisk/releases
-
- The release of Asterisk 10.5.1 resolves the following issue:
-

-  Channel driver. When an SCCP client sends an Off Hook message, followed by
-  a Key Pad Button Message, a structure that was previously set to NULL is
-  dereferenced.  This allows remote authenticated connections the ability to
-  cause a crash in the server, denying services to legitimate users.
-
- This issue and its resolution is described in the security advisory.

-
- The release of Asterisk 1.8.11-cert2, 1.8.12.1, and 10.4.1 resolve the following
- two issues:
-
- * A remotely exploitable crash vulnerability exists in the IAX2 channel
-  driver if an established call is placed on hold without a suggested music
-  class. Asterisk will attempt to use an invalid pointer to the music
-  on hold class name, potentially causing a crash.
-
- * A remotely exploitable crash vulnerability was found in the Skinny (SCCP)
-  Channel driver. When an SCCP client closes its connection to the server,
-  a pointer in a structure is set to NULL.  If the client was not in the
-  on-hook state at the time the connection was closed, this pointer is later
-  dereferenced. This allows remote authenticated connections the ability to
-  cause a crash in the server, denying services to legitimate users.
-
- These issues and their resolution are described in the security advisories.

* Tue Apr 24 2012 Jeffrey Ollie <jeff@ocjtech.us> - 10.3.1-1
- The Asterisk Development Team has announced security releases for Asterisk 1.6.2,
- 1.8, and 10. The available security releases are released as versions 1.6.2.24,
- 1.8.11.1, and 10.3.1.
-
- These releases are available for immediate download at
- http://downloads.asterisk.org/pub/telephony/asterisk/releases
-
- The release of Asterisk 1.6.2.24, 1.8.11.1, and 10.3.1 resolve the following two
- issues:
-
-  * A permission escalation vulnerability in Asterisk Manager Interface.  This
-   would potentially allow remote authenticated users the ability to execute
-   commands on the system shell with the privileges of the user running the
-   Asterisk application.
-
-  * A heap overflow vulnerability in the Skinny Channel driver.  The keypad
-   button message event failed to check the length of a fixed length buffer
-   before appending a received digit to the end of that buffer.  A remote
-   authenticated user could send sufficient keypad button message events that the
-   buffer would be overrun.
-
- In addition, the release of Asterisk 1.8.11.1 and 10.3.1 resolve the following
- issue:
-
-  * A remote crash vulnerability in the SIP channel driver when processing UPDATE
-   requests.  If a SIP UPDATE request was received indicating a connected line
-   update after a channel was terminated but before the final destruction of the
-   associated SIP dialog, Asterisk would attempt a connected line update on a
-   non-existing channel, causing a crash.
-
- These issues and their resolution are described in the security advisories.
-
- For more information about the details of these vulnerabilities, please read
- security advisories AST-2012-004, AST-2012-005, and AST-2012-006, which were

- The Asterisk Development Team is pleased to announce the release of
- Asterisk 10.1.0. This release is available for immediate download at
- http://downloads.asterisk.org/pub/telephony/asterisk/
-
- The release of Asterisk 10.1.0 resolves several issues reported by the
- community and would have not been possible without your participation.
- Thank you!
-
- The following is a sample of the issues resolved in this release:
-
- * AST-2012-001: prevent crash when an SDP offer
-  is received with an encrypted video stream when support for video
-  is disabled and res_srtp is loaded.  (closes issue ASTERISK-19202)
-  Reported by: Catalin Sanda
-
- * Allow playback of formats that don't support seeking.  ast_streamfile
-  previously did unconditional seeking on files that broke playback of
-  formats that don't support that functionality.  This patch avoids the
-  seek that was causing the problem.
-  (closes issue ASTERISK-18994) Patched by: Timo Teras
-
- * Add pjmedia probation concepts to res_rtp_asterisk's learning mode.  In
-  order to better handle RTP sources with strictrtp enabled (which is the
-  default setting in 10) using the learning mode to figure out new sources
-  when they change is handled by checking for a number of consecutive (by
-  sequence number) packets received to an rtp struct based on a new
-  configurable value called 'probation'.  Also, during learning mode instead
-  of liberally accepting all packets received, we now reject packets until a
-  clear source has been determined.
-
- * Handle AST_CONTROL_UPDATE_RTP_PEER frames in local bridge loop.  Failing
-  to handle AST_CONTROL_UPDATE_RTP_PEER frames in the local bridge loop
-  causes the loop to exit prematurely. This causes a variety of negative side
-  effects, depending on when the loop exits. This patch handles the frame by
-  essentially swallowing the frame in the local loop, as the current channel
-  drivers expect the RTP bridge to handle the frame, and, in the case of the
-  local bridge loop, no additional action is necessary.
-  (closes issue ASTERISK-19095) Reported by: Stefan Schmidt Tested
-  by: Matt Jordan
-
- * Fix timing source dependency issues with MOH.  Prior to this patch,
-  res_musiconhold existed at the same module priority level as the timing
-  sources that it depends on.  This would cause a problem when music on
-  hold was reloaded, as the timing source could be changed after
-  res_musiconhold was processed. This patch adds a new module priority
-  level, AST_MODPRI_TIMING, that the various timing modules are now loaded
-  at. This now occurs before loading other resource modules, such
-  that the timing source is guaranteed to be set prior to resolving
-  the timing source dependencies.

-
- * Fix RTP reference leak.  If a blind transfer were initiated using a
-  REFER without a prior reINVITE to place the call on hold, AND if Asterisk
-  were sending RTCP reports, then there was a reference leak for the
-  RTP instance of the transferrer.
-  (closes issue ASTERISK-19192) Reported by: Tyuta Vitali
-
- * Fix blind transfers from failing if an 'h' extension
-  is present.  This prevents the 'h' extension from being run on the
-  transferee channel when it is transferred via a native transfer
-  mechanism such as SIP REFER.  (closes issue ASTERISK-19173) Reported
-  by: Ross Beer Tested by: Kristjan Vrban Patches: ASTERISK-19173 by
-  Mark Michelson (license 5049)
-
- * Restore call progress code for analog ports. Extracting sig_analog
-  from chan_dahdi lost call progress detection functionality.  Fix
-  analog ports from considering a call answered immediately after
-  dialing has completed if the callprogress option is enabled.
-  (closes issue ASTERISK-18841)
-  Reported by: Richard Miller Patched by Richard Miller

* Fri Dec  9 2011 Jeffrey C. Ollie <jeff@ocjtech.us> - 10.0.0-0.7.rc3
- The Asterisk Development Team has announced the third release candidate of
- Asterisk 10.0.0. This release candidate is available for immediate download at
- http://downloads.asterisk.org/pub/telephony/asterisk/
-
- The release of Asterisk 10.0.0-rc3 resolves several issues reported by the
- community and would have not been possible without your participation.
- Thank you!
-
- The following is a sample of the issues resolved in this release candidate:
-
- * Add ASTSBINDIR to the list of configurable paths
-
-  This patch also makes astdb2sqlite3 and astcanary use the configured
-  directory instead of relying on $PATH.
-
- * Don't crash on INFO automon request with no channel
-
-  AST-2011-014. When automon was enabled in features.conf, it was possible
-  to crash Asterisk by sending an INFO request if no channel had been
-  created yet.
-
- * Fixed crash from orphaned MWI subscriptions in chan_sip
-
-  This patch resolves the issue where MWI subscriptions are orphaned
-  by subsequent SIP SUBSCRIBE messages.
-
- * Fix a change in behavior in 'database show' from 1.8.
-
-  In 1.8 and previous versions, one could use any fullword portion of
-  the key name, including the full key, to obtain the record. Until this
-  patch, this did not work for the full key.
-
- * Default to nat=yes; warn when nat in general and peer differ
-
-  AST-2011-013.  It is possible to enumerate SIP usernames when the general and
-  user/peer nat settings differ in whether to respond to the port a request is
-  sent from or the port listed for responses in the Via header. In 1.4 and
-  1.6.2, this would mean if one setting was nat=yes or nat=route and the other
-  was either nat=no or nat=never. In 1.8 and 10, this would mean when one
-  was nat=force_rport and the other was nat=no.
-
-  In order to address this problem, it was decided to switch the default
-  behavior to nat=yes/force_rport as it is the most commonly used option
-  and to strongly discourage setting nat per-peer/user when at all
-  possible.
-
- * Fixed SendMessage stripping extension from To: header in SIP MESSAGE
-
-  When using the MessageSend application to send a SIP MESSAGE to a
-  non-peer, chan_sip stripped off the extension and failed to add it back
-  to the sip_pvt structure before transmitting. This patch adds the full
-  URI passed in from the message core to the sip_pvt structure.

- The release of Asterisk 1.4.41.2, 1.6.2.18.2, and 1.8.4.4 resolves the
- following issue:
-
- AST-2011-011: Asterisk may respond differently to SIP requests from an
- invalid SIP user than it does to a user configured on the system, even
- when the alwaysauthreject option is set in the configuration. This can
- leak information about what SIP users are valid on the Asterisk
- system.

- http://downloads.asterisk.org/pub/telephony/asterisk/releases
-
- The release of Asterisk 1.4.41.1, 1.6.2.18, and 1.8.4.3 resolves several issues
- as outlined below:
-
- * AST-2011-008: If a remote user sends a SIP packet containing a null,
-  Asterisk assumes available data extends past the null to the
-  end of the packet when the buffer is actually truncated when
-  copied.  This causes SIP header parsing to modify data past
-  the end of the buffer altering unrelated memory structures.
-  This vulnerability does not affect TCP/TLS connections.
-  -- Resolved in 1.6.2.18.1 and 1.8.4.3
-
- * AST-2011-009: A remote user sending a SIP packet containing a Contact header
-  with a missing left angle bracket (<) causes Asterisk to
-  access a null pointer.
-  -- Resolved in 1.8.4.3
-
- * AST-2011-010: A memory address was inadvertently transmitted over the
-  network via IAX2 via an option control frame and the remote party would try
-  to access it.
-  -- Resolved in 1.4.41.1, 1.6.2.18.1, and 1.8.4.3
-
- The issues and resolutions are described in the AST-2011-008, AST-2011-009, and

* Wed Oct  6 2010 Jeffrey C. Ollie <jeff@ocjtech.us> - 1.8.0-0.6.rc2
- This release candidate contains fixes since the last beta release as reported by
- the community. A sampling of the changes in this release candidate include:
-
-  * Add slin16 support for format_wav (new wav16 file extension)
-    (Closes issue #15029. Reported, patched by andrew. Tested by Qwell)
-
-  * Fixes a bug in manager.c where the default configuration values weren't reset
-    when the manager configuration was reloaded.
-    (Closes issue #17917. Reported by lmadsen. Patched by bbryant)
-
-  * Various fixes for the calendar modules.
-    (Patched by Jan Kalab.
-     Reviewboard: https://reviewboard.asterisk.org/r/880/
-     Closes issue #17877. Review: https://reviewboard.asterisk.org/r/916/
-     Closes issue #17776. Review: https://reviewboard.asterisk.org/r/921/)
-

-    (Closes issue #17408, Reported, patched by sysreq)
-
-  * Fix interoperability problems with session timer behavior in Asterisk.
-    (Closes issue #17005. Reported by alexcarey. Patched by dvossel)
-
-  * Rate limit calls to fsync() to 1 per second after astdb updates. Astdb was
-    determined to be one of the most significant bottlenecks in SIP registration
-    processing. This patch improved the speed of an astdb load test by 50000%
-    (yes, Fifty-Thousand Percent). On this particular load test setup, this
-    doubled the number of SIP registrations the server could handle.
-    (Review: https://reviewboard.asterisk.org/r/825/)
-
-  * Don't clear the username from a realtime database when a registration
-    expires. Non-realtime chan_sip does not clear the username from memory when a
-    registration expiries so realtime probably shouldn't either.
-    (Closes issue #17551. Reported, patched by: ricardolandim. Patched by
-     mnicholson)
-
-  * Don't hang up a call on an SRTP unprotect failure. Also make it more obvious
-    when there is an issue en/decrypting.
-    (Closes issue #17563. Reported by Alexcr. Patched by sfritsch. Tested by
-     twilson)

* Thu Sep  9 2010 Jeffrey C. Ollie <jeff@ocjtech.us> - 1.8.0-0.5.beta5
- This release contains fixes since the last beta release as reported by the
- community. A sampling of the changes in this release include:
-

-    (Closes issue #17890. Reported, patched by elguero)
-
-  * Change pedantic default value in chan_sip from 'no' to 'yes'
-
-  * Asterisk now dynamically builds the "Supported" header depending on what is
-    enabled/disabled in sip.conf. Session timers used to always be advertised as
-    being supported even when they were disabled in the configuration.
-    (Related to issue #17005. Patched by dvossel)
-
-  * Convert MOH to use generic timers.
-    (Closes issue #17726. Reported by lmadsen. Patched by tilghman)
-
-  * Fix SRTP for changing SSRC and multiple a=crypto SDP lines. Adding code to
-    Asterisk that changed the SSRC during bridges and masquerades broke SRTP
-    functionality. Also broken was handling the situation where an incoming
-    INVITE had more than one crypto offer.
-    (Closes issue #17563. Reported by Alexcr. Patched by twilson)
-

-    broken/useless STUN support from chan_sip.
-    (Closes issue #17622. Reported by philipp2.
-     Review: https://reviewboard.asterisk.org/r/855/)
-
-  * PRI CCSS may use a stale dial string for the recall dial string. If an
-    outgoing call negotiates a different B channel than initially requested, the
-    saved original dial string was not transferred to the new B channel. CCSS
-    uses that dial string to generate the recall dial string.
-    (Patched by rmudgett)
-
-  * Split _all_ arguments before parsing them. This fixes multicast RTP paging
-    using linksys mode.
-    (Patched by russellb)
-
-  * Expand cel_custom.conf.sample. Include the usage of CSV_QUOTE() to ensure
-    data has valid CSV formatting. Also list the special CEL variables that are
-    available for use in the mapping. There are also several other CEL fixes in
-    this release.

-    (https://reviewboard.asterisk.org/r/804)
-
-  * Fix parsing error in sip_sipredirect(). The code was written in a way that
-    did a bad job of parsing the port out of a URI. Specifically, it would do
