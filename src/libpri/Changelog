* Mon Aug  2 2010 Jeffrey C. Ollie <jeff@ocjtech.us> - 1.4.11.3-1
- 1.4.11.3:
- This release fixes a regression in the calling number assignment logic:
-
-  * Calling Number assignment logic change in libpri 1.4.11. Restored the old
-    behaviour if there is more than one calling number in the incoming SETUP
-    message.  A network provided number is reported as ANI.
-    (Closes issue #17495. Reported and tested by ibercom. Patched by rmudgett)

- 1.4.11.2:
-
- This release fixes situation where Q.SIG calling name in FACILITY
- message was not reported to the upper layer:
-
- * pri_facility.c: Q.SIG calling name in FACILITY message not reported
-   to the upper layer. Q.SIG can send the CallingName, CalledName, and
-   ConnectedName in stand alone FACILITY messages.  If the CallingName
-   was not sent in the SETUP message, the caller id name was not
-   reported to the upper layer.  (Closes issue #17458. Reported, tested
-   by: jsmith. Patched by rmudgett)
-
- For a full list of changes in the current release, please see the

-
- 1.4.11.1:
-
- This release fixes a regression in multi component FACILITY messages
- and includes a minor bug fix for BRI spans:
-
- * Multi component FACILITY messages only process the first
-   component. The code was only processing the first ROSE component in
-   the facility message.  (Closes issue #17428. Reported, tested by:
-   patrol-cz. Patched by rmudgett)
-
- * Inband disconnect setting does nothing on BRI spans.  The
-   acceptinbanddisconnect flag is not inherited when creating a new TEI
-   and thus rendering the setting (and its respective equivalent in
-   Asterisk) a no-op on BRI setups.  (Closes issue #15265. Reported,
-   patched, tested by: paravoid)

* Wed May 26 2010 Jeffrey C. Ollie <jeff@ocjtech.us> - 1.4.11-1
- This release contains many fixes and new features, among them being:
-
- 1.) Support for NT-PTMP BRI links, including support for multiple TEIs
- and connecting of BRI phones.
-
- 2.) Support for allowing persistent Q.921 drops on both NT and TE PTMP
- links, as well as automatically requesting that Q.921 data links
- reactivate when needed by Q.931.
-
- 3.) T309 is enabled by default.
-
- 4.) Problems with Keypad Facility Digits were addressed.
-
- 5.) A number of additional service related features were added:
- Connected Line Information, HOLD/RELEASE support, Call Deflection/Call
- Rerouting, as well as partial subaddress support.  They are supported in
- the Q.SIG and EuroISDN switch types, and most currently require using
- the trunk version of Asterisk.
-
- 6.) Many potential and realized Q.921 related problems, particularly
- during retransmissions and other scenarios involving medium to high
- packet loss.
